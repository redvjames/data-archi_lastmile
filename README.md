In the company's operations, an important pre-delivery activity is manpower prediction. The delivery riders are not part of the company's employees but are provided by a third-party services provider (TPSP). The number of riders employed is subject to weekly negotiations between the company and the third-party service provider (TPSP). Therefore, the WZP WZP must accurately predict the manpower for delivering all the packages in their custody. Similarly, employing descriptive analytics on packages will yield valuable insights into the types of packages the delivery hub anticipates receiving. Armed with this knowledge, delivery hubs can make more informed decisions about how to efficiently group packages based on their characteristics and the available workforce.

The study aims to create a data architecture that helps solve these manpower predictions and package batching challenges, from the seamless raw data preprocessing to loading it to data lakes and warehouses.

Data used in the code are created manually for the implementation
